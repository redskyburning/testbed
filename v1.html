			<p>The way led along upon what had once been the embankment of a railroad.  But no train had run upon it for many years. The forest on either side  swelled up the slopes of the embankment and crested across it in a green  wave of trees and bushes. The trail was as narrow as a man's body, and  was no more than a wild-animal runway. Occasionally, a piece of rusty  iron, showing through the forest-mould, advertised that the rail and the  ties still remained. In one place, a ten-inch tree, bursting through at  a connection, had lifted the end of a rail clearly into view. The tie  had evidently followed the rail, held to it by the spike long enough  for its bed to be filled with gravel and rotten leaves, so that now the  crumbling, rotten timber thrust itself up at a curious slant. Old as the  road was, it was manifest that it had been of the mono-rail type.</p>

				<li>We talked through the air in those days, thousands and thousands of miles</li>
				<li>And the word came of a strange disease that had broken out in New York</li>
				<li>There were seventeen millions of people living then in that noblest city of America</li>
				<li>Nobody thought anything about the news</li>
				<li>It was only a small thing</li>

			<p>An old man and a boy travelled along this runway. They moved slowly, for  the old man was very old, a touch of palsy made his movements tremulous,  and he leaned heavily upon his staff. A rude skull-cap of goat-skin  protected his head from the sun. From beneath this fell a scant fringe  of stained and dirty-white hair. A visor, ingeniously made from a large  leaf, shielded his eyes, and from under this he peered at the way of  his feet on the trail. His beard, which should have been snow-white  but which showed the same weather-wear and camp-stain as his hair,  fell nearly to his waist in a great tangled mass. About his chest and  shoulders hung a single, mangy garment of goat-skin. His arms and legs,  withered and skinny, betokened extreme age, as well as did their sunburn  and scars and scratches betoken long years of exposure to the elements.</p>
